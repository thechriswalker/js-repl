# JS-REPL

Yet another in-browser Javascript REPL.

## Why?

For fun. To Try CodeMirror (http://codemirror.net).

Because I wanted an as-you-type syntax highlighted javascript repl that looked good.

## Caveat Emptor

I only ever used this in Chrome. It may or may not work anywhere else and makes no 
attempt to check for availability for the availability of the APIs it uses (things 
like `localStorage` and `querySelector`). YMMV.
